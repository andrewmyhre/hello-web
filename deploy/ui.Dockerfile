# The hello-web UI image: the SvelteKit static build served by nginx as a
# non-root user. Built by the build-ui step in .woodpecker.yml on every push
# to main, and locally from the repository root with:
#
#   docker build -f deploy/ui.Dockerfile -t hello-web-ui .
#
# Stage 1 installs from the lockfile and builds ui/build; stage 2 is
# nginx-unprivileged (uid 101, listening on 8080) with deploy/ui-nginx.conf.

FROM node:22.23.4-bookworm AS build
# corepack reads the pinned pnpm from ui/package.json's packageManager.
